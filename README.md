# CRM in JS with indexDB
This is a small CMR customer management project developed with JavaScript HTML CSS3.
It allows to create, modify and delete customers using indexedDB.

For **Alert** it uses the **sweetalert** library.

#### Design 
I mocked up the FIGMA design of [Avi Yansah](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1146467298668328949/CRM-Dashboard-Customers-List)
